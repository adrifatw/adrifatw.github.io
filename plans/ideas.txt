start with 10 gambucks
each keep gambling -0.25 gambucks
sweet +1
oh yeah +10
oh fuck yeah +50
go below 0 gambucks -> loss
win condition: get a certain amount of gambucks to buy an item?
    pros for this approach: gives player freedom to get to goal how they will (could technically win by attrition)
    could give the player many different ways to earn money that require different gambles/bets to be made to pay off (facilitated through items in shop)
item shop ideas:
    should start innocuous
    should interact with each other...each item should give the player an RPG-like scenario (very *very* light "RPG" - (e.g., "do you want to spend x gambucks to hire a mercenary? 50% chance of success with 150% payout" then "you were caught giving money to mercs..." changes access to other items?))
starter item: avoid the tedium of early stages (could decrease the fun factor of getting a big hit early on...)
    should send the player on a specific "path"
